Your application must store over 80 gigabytes of messages in a queue.
Your application wants to track progress for processing a message in the queue. It's useful if the worker processing a message crashes. Another worker can then use that information to continue from where the prior worker left off.
You require server side logs of all of the transactions executed against your queues.
